# LoRaWAN-Current-Sensing-EndNode

Traditionally, remote monitoring has been done using wired communications technologies such as ethernet and fiberoptics. In the last decade, low power narrow band radio communications technologies, such as LoRaWAN, have enabled wireless remote monitoring in microgrids.  Installing remote monitoring systems can be very costly using both wired or wireless communication schemes. Wired connections are expensive during installation and wireless connections are expensive during operation due to service subscriptions and may also require pre-existing infrastructure to operate. This project provides a modular solution for monitoring power output from photovoltaic panels remotely.

This page contains the design files and software for a current-sensing end node for photovoltaic panels in microgrids using the LoRaWAN network.
